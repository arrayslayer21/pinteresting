<h1>About us</h1>
<p>We are working on our One month Rails Pinteresting app! I've always been entrigued by technology, computer programing in general. Just never persued it due to the fear of failing out of school, it seemed like a very hard subject to tackle. After years of different dead-end jobs and debating what I was going to take up as a career, I deciced to teach my self coding. Although it's not easy i have been able to supplement my learning with some awesome tools, by far the best tool i've found is One Month Rails. It's easy to use, if you ever get stuck there's a troubleshooting and support tab where you can get answers, but best of all i've learned to debug errors my self with the power of Google and Stackoverflow.</p>
